[November Five](http://novemberfive.co/) (formerly [Appstrakt](http://www.appstrakt.com/)) will come talk about two interesting and topical subjects in the tech world.
You don't want to miss this!

##### Devops

Lately, there's been a lot of word out in the street (or at least the streets of Palo
Alto) about 'devops', the cultural change that aims to bring software developers and
IT operations closer together.
Seven years after the term was first introduced, there's still a lot of confusion
about what the term actually means.
In this talk, we'll take a look at what devops is, where it came from and what you
should know about it as a computer scientist.

Summary:

- Definition of devops, and why "devops engineer" is not a valid job title.
- IT Infrastructure as code (config management, AWS/docker, continuous delivery).
- The water-agile-fall model.
- Devops at Appstrakt.

##### IoT

After our former talk by Bell Labs where we saw a general overview of what IoT is
all about we'll get a more practical use case here.
November Five will talk about the underlying device they used to jump start their IoT
development, the Photon from [Particle](https://www.particle.io/),
and how they did it.

##### Details

As usual there will be **free food and drinks.**

**WHEN**: Monday 14 March, 18u

**WHERE**: Campus Middelheim, MG010

**SIGN UP**: Attend our event on [Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/events/1688184698130966/) so we can plan how much food we have to provide.
